## Overview of NLP and Word Vectorization

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It involves various techniques, including tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, lemmatization, and word vectorization, to process and analyze textual data.

### 1. **Stemming and Lemmatization**
Stemming and lemmatization are text normalization techniques that reduce words to their base or root form.

**Stemming**: This method chops off word suffixes using heuristic rules without considering the word's actual meaning. *(removing the ends of words where the end signals some sort of derivational change to the word)* It often results in non-dictionary words.
  - **Example:** "running" â†’ "run", "flies" â†’ "fli" (incorrect stem)
  - **Common algorithm:** **Porter Stemmer**, **Snowball Stemmer**

  | Rule    | Example             |
|---------|---------------------|
| **SSES â†’ SS** | caresses â†’ caress |
| **IES â†’ I**   | ponies â†’ poni     |
| **SS â†’ SS**   | caress â†’ caress   |
| **S â†’** S     | cats â†’ cat        |


**Lemmatization**: This method converts words to their base form (lemma) using vocabulary and morphological analysis, ensuring the output is a valid word. Attempts to reduce each word to its most basic form, or lemma.
  - **Example:** "running" â†’ "run", "flies" â†’ "fly"
  - **Common algorithm:** **WordNet Lemmatizer**

 | Word    | Stem | Lemma |
|---------|--------|----|
| **Studies** | Studi | Study |
| **Studying** | Study | Study |
  
---

  Here's a table comparing **stemming** and **lemmatization** with examples:

| Feature        | Stemming                             | Lemmatization                        |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Definition    | Reduces a word to its root by removing suffixes, without considering context. | Converts a word to its base form (lemma) using vocabulary and morphological analysis. |
| Algorithm    | Uses rules like removing common suffixes (e.g., *ing*, *ed*). | Uses a dictionary to find the correct lemma. |
| Speed        | Faster, as it applies simple rules. | Slower, as it considers word meaning. |
| Accuracy     | Less accurate; may produce non-existent words. | More accurate; results in valid words. |
| Example 1 (run) | Running â†’ **Run** | Running â†’ **Run** |
| Example 2 (better) | Better â†’ **Better** (unchanged) | Better â†’ **Good** (correct lemma) |
| Example 3 (studying) | Studying â†’ **Studi** | Studying â†’ **Study** |
| Example 4 (flies) | Flies â†’ **Fli** | Flies â†’ **Fly** (correct base form) |

Stemming often results in non-dictionary words (*studi*, *fli*), whereas lemmatization ensures the word is meaningful in the language.

Lemmatization is more accurate than stemming but computationally expensive.

### 2. **Stop Words and Their Removal**
Stop words are commonly used words in a language (e.g., "the", "is", "and") that do not contribute meaningful information to text analysis. They are frequently removed in NLP tasks to reduce dimensionality and improve computational efficiency.

- **Why Remove Stop Words?**
  - They do not add significant meaning to text processing tasks.
  - Removing them improves model performance and reduces processing time.
  - Helps focus on important words that contribute to understanding the text.

Common stop word lists are provided in NLP libraries like **NLTK** and **spaCy**.

### 3. **Tokenization in NLP**
Tokenization is the process of breaking text into smaller units, called tokens. These tokens can be words, phrases, or sentences.

- **Types of Tokenization:**
  - **Word Tokenization**: Splits text into individual words.
    - Example: `"I love NLP!"` â†’ `["I", "love", "NLP", "!"]`
  - **Sentence Tokenization**: Splits text into sentences.
    - Example: `"Hello world. NLP is amazing!"` â†’ `["Hello world.", "NLP is amazing!"]`

Tokenization is a fundamental preprocessing step in NLP.

### 4. **TF-IDF Vectorization**
TF-IDF (**Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency**) is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection (corpus) of documents. It helps in filtering out commonly used words while keeping important terms.

#### **Components of TF-IDF:**
1. **Term Frequency (TF)**: Measures how frequently a term appears in a document.

   $$\large Term\ Frequency(t) = \frac{number\ of\ times\ t\ appears\ in\ a\ document} {total\ number\ of\ terms\ in\ the\ document} $$ 


2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: Measures how important a term is by penalizing common words that appear across many documents.

  $$\large IDF(t) = log_e(\frac{Total\ Number\ of\ Documents}{Number\ of\ Documents\ with\ t\ in\ it})$$


3. **TF-IDF Score**: The final score for a term is calculated as:

   $$\TF-IDF(t) = TF(t) \times IDF(t)\$$

A higher TF-IDF score means a term is more important in a specific document.

### 5. **Count Vectorization and Bag of Words (BoW)**
Count vectorization is a technique that converts text into a matrix of token counts, representing the frequency of words in documents.

#### **Relationship to Bag of Words:**
- The **Bag of Words (BoW)** model represents text as a collection of words, ignoring grammar and word order.
- Count vectorization follows the BoW model by creating a matrix where:
  - Rows represent documents.
  - Columns represent unique words.
  - Values indicate word frequency.

#### **Example:**
Consider two sentences:
1. `"I love NLP"`
2. `"NLP is great"`

Count vectorization results in:
```
       I  love  NLP  is  great
Doc1   1   1    1   0    0
Doc2   0   0    1   1    1
```
Each row is a document, and each column represents word counts.

While count vectorization provides raw frequency counts, **TF-IDF refines this by giving importance to unique words while reducing common word influence**.
