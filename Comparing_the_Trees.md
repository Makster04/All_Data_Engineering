# **Comparison of Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging Forest, and Extra Trees**

## **1. Decision Tree (Very Sensitive to Tree Depth and Not Robust)**

A **Decision Tree** is a recursive structure that makes splits based on entropy or impurity (e.g., Gini impurity or entropy for classification, mean squared error for regression). The goal is to split on the feature that best increases information gain at each node.

### **How It Works:**
1. Recursively split data on features that maximize information gain.
2. Continue splitting until a leaf node is pure (contains only one class or has minimal variance for regression).
3. High-depth trees fit the training set perfectly, leading to **overfitting**.
4. Decision boundaries vary depending on different training realizations (random samples from the dataset).
5. To prevent overfitting, **reduce the tree depth**, but this can lead to **underfitting**.

### **Key Characteristics:**
- **Criterion Choice:** Determines the quality of a split (e.g., "culmen length" for a bird dataset).
- **Lack of Feature Communication:** Once a split is made on a feature, different subsets of data never interact again.
- **Speed:** Decision trees are computationally efficient but sensitive to noise and variance.

### **Improving Decision Trees:**
- **Pruning:** Reduce depth by limiting splits based on node impurity thresholds.
- **Ensemble Methods:** Use multiple trees to improve stability (e.g., Random Forest, Bagging, Extra Trees).

## **2. Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation)**

Bagging is an **ensemble learning technique** that reduces variance by training multiple models on different bootstrap samples (samples with replacement).

### **How It Works:**
1. Create multiple bootstrapped datasets (randomly sampled with replacement).
2. Train a weak learner (typically a decision tree) on each dataset.
3. Aggregate predictions:
   - **For classification:** Majority vote across trees.
   - **For regression:** Average predictions across trees.

### **Key Properties:**
- **Addresses Variance Issues:** Bootstrapped samples create diversity in training data, reducing reliance on specific data points.
- **Aggregation Smooths Predictions:** Large fluctuations in class assignments are reduced by averaging outputs.
- **Bagging Classifier:** A wrapper around other estimators to perform bagging.

### **Bagging vs. Random Forest:**
- **Bagging Forest:** Uses **all M features** for splitting nodes.
- **Random Forest:** Uses a **subset of m < M features** per split, reducing correlation between trees.

### **Limitations:**
- Bootstrapped samples are still highly correlated with each other.
- Bagging alone does not capture feature interactions efficiently.

#### **Python Implementation:**
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load dataset
iris = load_iris()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define a Bagging classifier
bagging_clf = BaggingClassifier(base_estimator=DecisionTreeClassifier(), n_estimators=150, random_state=42)

# Pipeline for scaling and classification
bag_pipe = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('model', bagging_clf)
])

# Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search
params = {'model__n_estimators': [50, 100, 150]}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(bag_pipe, params, cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate model
best_model = grid_search.best_estimator_
y_pred = best_model.predict(X_test)
print(f"Bagging Forest Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred):.2f}")
```

## **3. Random Forest**

Random Forest is a **Bagging-based ensemble of Decision Trees**, but unlike Bagging, it **randomly selects a subset of features (m < M) for each node split**, making trees more independent and reducing correlation.

### **Advantages:**
- **Reduces Overfitting:** More generalizable than a single decision tree.
- **Handles Missing Data:** Can work well even with missing values.
- **Feature Importance:** Provides insight into feature influence.

### **Python Implementation:**
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Train a Random Forest
rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
rf_pred = rf.predict(X_test)

print(f"Random Forest Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, rf_pred):.2f}")
```

---

## **4. Extra Trees (Extremely Randomized Trees)**

Extra Trees (**Extreme Randomization**) is similar to Random Forest but introduces **three levels of randomization**:
1. **Bootstrapped Sampling of Data** (same as Bagging and Random Forest).
2. **Random Selection of Features for Splitting** (like Random Forest but more aggressive).
3. **Random Selection of Split Points Instead of Best Split** (further reduces variance).

### **Advantages:**
- **Faster Than Random Forest:** Since it does not search for the best split at each node.
- **Stronger Regularization:** More randomness leads to better generalization but may perform worse on small datasets.

### **Python Implementation:**
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesClassifier

# Train an Extra Trees model
extra_trees = ExtraTreesClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
extra_trees.fit(X_train, y_train)
extra_pred = extra_trees.predict(X_test)

print(f"Extra Trees Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, extra_pred):.2f}")
```
