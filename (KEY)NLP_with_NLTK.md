## **Introduction to NLP with NLTK**

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. The **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)** is one of the most popular Python libraries for NLP, providing tools for text processing, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, POS tagging, and more.

## **1. Overview of NLP with NLTK**
### **What is NLP?**
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines to process and analyze large amounts of text.

### **What is NLTK?**
The **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)** is an open-source Python library for working with human language data. It includes:
- Tokenization (splitting text into words/sentences)
- Stemming and Lemmatization (reducing words to their root form)
- Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Sentiment Analysis
- Parsing and Syntactic Analysis

---

## **2. Important Definitions**
### **Tokenization**
Breaking text into words or sentences.
- **Word Tokenization**: Splitting text into individual words.
- **Sentence Tokenization**: Splitting text into sentences.

### **Stemming**
Reducing words to their root form (e.g., "running" â†’ "run").

### **Lemmatization**
Similar to stemming, but it converts words to their base form using a dictionary (e.g., "better" â†’ "good").

### **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**
Assigning grammatical labels to words (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).

### **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
Identifying entities such as names, locations, organizations in text.

### **Stopwords**
Common words that do not add much meaning (e.g., "the", "is", "and", "a").

### **Bag of Words (BoW)**
A text representation method where words are converted into numerical vectors.

## **3. Coding with NLTK**
### **Installation**
```bash
pip install nltk
```
Import NLTK and download necessary datasets:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')  # For tokenization
nltk.download('stopwords')  # Stopwords
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')  # POS tagging
nltk.download('wordnet')  # Lemmatization
nltk.download('maxent_ne_chunker')  # Named Entity Recognition
nltk.download('words')  # Named Entity Recognition
```

---

### **Example 1: Tokenization**
```python
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize

text = "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an exciting field. It enables computers to understand human language."
word_tokens = word_tokenize(text)
sentence_tokens = sent_tokenize(text)

print("Word Tokenization:", word_tokens)
print("Sentence Tokenization:", sentence_tokens)
```

---

### **Example 2: Removing Stopwords**
```python
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
filtered_words = [word for word in word_tokens if word.lower() not in stop_words]

print("Filtered Words (Without Stopwords):", filtered_words)
```

---

### **Example 3: Stemming and Lemmatization**
```python
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer

stemmer = PorterStemmer()
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

words = ["running", "flies", "easily", "better"]

print("Stemming Results:")
for word in words:
    print(word, "â†’", stemmer.stem(word))

print("\nLemmatization Results:")
for word in words:
    print(word, "â†’", lemmatizer.lemmatize(word))
```

---

### **Example 4: Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**
```python
from nltk import pos_tag

pos_tags = pos_tag(word_tokens)
print("POS Tags:", pos_tags)
```

---

### **Example 5: Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
```python
from nltk import ne_chunk

nltk.download('maxent_ne_chunker')
nltk.download('words')

ner_tree = ne_chunk(pos_tags)
print(ner_tree)
```

---

### **Example 6: Bag of Words Representation**
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

corpus = [
    "NLP is amazing.",
    "I love natural language processing.",
    "Machines can understand human language."
]

vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)

print("Bag of Words Representation:")
print(X.toarray())
print("Feature Names:", vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
```

---

## **4. Applications of NLP with NLTK**
- **Chatbots**
- **Sentiment Analysis**
- **Text Summarization**
- **Machine Translation**
- **Speech Recognition**
- **Spam Detection**

---

## **5. Summary**
- **NLTK** is a powerful library for NLP tasks.
- **Tokenization**, **stemming**, **lemmatization**, **POS tagging**, and **NER** are fundamental NLP tasks.
- **Stopwords** are removed to improve efficiency.
- **Bag of Words (BoW)** is a popular way to represent text numerically.
