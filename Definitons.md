- **K-Nearest Neigboor**: An effective classification and regression algorithm that uses nearby points in order to generate a prediction.
- **Supervised Learning:** Training models using labeled data (data with known output values) to predict specific outcomes or classifications.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Training models using unlabeled data (data without known output values) to discover hidden patterns, groupings, or structures within the data, rather than predicting specific outcomes.
- **Manhattan Distance:** Measures the total horizontal and vertical distance between two points, like city blocks, used in machine learning and optimization.  
- **Euclidean Distance:** The shortest straight-line distance between two points, commonly used in machine learning for measuring similarity.  
- **Minkowski Distance:** A flexible distance formula that generalizes both Manhattan and Euclidean distances by adjusting a parameter.
