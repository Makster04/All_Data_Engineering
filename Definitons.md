- **K-Nearest Neigboor**: An effective classification and regression algorithm that uses nearby points in order to generate a prediction.

- **Supervised Learning:** Training models using labeled data (data with known output values) to predict specific outcomes or classifications.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Training models using unlabeled data (data without known output values) to discover hidden patterns, groupings, or structures within the data, rather than predicting specific outcomes.
