- ```GridSearchCV:``` A hyperparameter tuning technique in machine learning that exhaustively searches over a specified parameter grid to find the best combination of hyperparameters for a given model, using cross-validation to evaluate performance.
- ```Cross-Validation:``` A model evaluation technique in machine learning that splits the dataset into multiple subsets (or "folds") to train and test the model on different partitions, ensuring better generalization and reducing overfitting.
- ```K-Nearest Neigboor:``` An effective classification and regression algorithm that uses nearby points in order to generate a prediction.
- ```Supervised Learning:``` Training models using labeled data (data with known output values) to predict specific outcomes or classifications.
- ```Unsupervised Learning:``` Training models using unlabeled data (data without known output values) to discover hidden patterns, groupings, or structures within the data, rather than predicting specific outcomes.
- ```Manhattan Distance:``` Measures the total horizontal and vertical distance between two points, like city blocks, used in machine learning and optimization.  
- ```Euclidean Distance:``` The shortest straight-line distance between two points, commonly used in machine learning for measuring similarity.  
- ```Minkowski Distance:``` A flexible distance formula that generalizes both Manhattan and Euclidean distances by adjusting a parameter.
