- ```GridSearchCV:``` A hyperparameter tuning technique in machine learning that exhaustively searches over a specified parameter grid to find the best combination of hyperparameters for a given model, using cross-validation to evaluate performance.
- ```Pipeline:``` A machine learning pipeline automates tasks by processing data in steps like cleaning, selecting features, training a model, and evaluating it, ensuring consistency, efficiency, and easy reuse, often using scikit-learn.
- ```Cross-Validation:``` A model evaluation technique in machine learning that splits the dataset into multiple subsets (or "folds") to train and test the model on different partitions, ensuring better generalization and reducing overfitting.
- ```K-Nearest Neigboor:``` An effective classification and regression algorithm that uses nearby points in order to generate a prediction.
- ```Supervised Learning:``` Training models using labeled data (data with known output values) to predict specific outcomes or classifications.
- ```Unsupervised Learning:``` Training models using unlabeled data (data without known output values) to discover hidden patterns, groupings, or structures within the data, rather than predicting specific outcomes.
- ```Manhattan Distance:``` Measures the total horizontal and vertical distance between two points, like city blocks, used in machine learning and optimization.  
- ```Euclidean Distance:``` The shortest straight-line distance between two points, commonly used in machine learning for measuring similarity.  
- ```Minkowski Distance:``` A flexible distance formula that generalizes both Manhattan and Euclidean distances by adjusting a parameter.
- ```Training on Different Realizations:``` A technique where a model is trained on multiple versions of a dataset to improve generalization and robustness by capturing variations in the data.  
- ```Criterion:``` A function used to measure a model’s performance, such as loss functions in machine learning or splitting criteria in decision trees.  
- ```Culmen Length:``` The measurement of a bird’s upper beak from base to tip, often used in biological and ecological studies.  
- ```Recursion:``` A process where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem, commonly used in algorithms like factorial computation and tree traversal.  
- ```Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation):``` An ensemble learning method that improves model accuracy by training multiple models on randomly sampled subsets of data and averaging their predictions.
- ```Decision Boundaries:``` In machine learning, decision boundaries separate different classes in a feature space. A model uses these boundaries to classify new data points based on learned patterns.
- ```Decision Tree:``` A machine learning algorithm that splits data into branches based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure to make predictions in classification and regression tasks.  
- ```Random Forest:``` An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees on different data subsets and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.  
- ```Bagging Forest:``` A variation of the random forest that uses bootstrap aggregation (bagging) to train multiple decision trees independently on random subsets of data and combines their outputs for better generalization.  
- ```Extra Forest (Extremely Randomized Trees):``` A variant of the random forest that introduces more randomness by selecting feature split points randomly, leading to faster training and often improved generalization.
- ```Computation Time:``` The total time required for a computer to execute a given task or algorithm, typically measured in milliseconds, seconds, or longer. It depends on factors like algorithm complexity, hardware efficiency, and data size.
- ```Model Deployment:``` Making a trained machine learning model available for use in real-world applications.  
- ```Pickled:``` Saving a machine learning model so it can be reused later without retraining.  
- ```Cloud Function:``` A small piece of code that runs automatically when triggered, often used to serve machine learning models without needing a full server.
- ```Prune:```
- ```learning_rate:```
- ```n_estimators:```
- ```Gradient Boosting:```
- ```XG Boost Estimators:```
